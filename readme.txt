The Twitter Media Endpoint plugin allows you to turn your Wordpress install in to a Twitpic/YFrog like service for your mobile device.

== Description ==

Twitter Media Endpoint allows you to use your Wordpress install with your Twitter client to upload media, and host it on your site, where you maintain control and ownership.

When you use a service like Twitpic to upload media your media falls under that site's terms. You often lose most, if not all rights to your photos. With Twitter Media Endpoint you are uploading you images to you personal blog. A site you own have control over, thus you maintain control of your work.
